                    Mohammed Assaf, the first Palestinian to win the Arab Idol TV singing competition, has also become
                    the UN's first Palestinian Goodwill Ambassador at the age of 23. A representative for both his
                    generation and for his people, Assaf has made his fellow Palestinians immensely proud. He was born
                    in Libya to Palestinian refugee parents and then returned to the Gaza Strip with his family at age 4
                    where he was raised in the refugee camp in Khan Younis under very difficult conditions. As a child,
                    Assaf would sing at weddings and events in order to help his parents make ends meet. However, since
                    using his “golden voice” to win Arab Idol, Assaf has embraced not only fame, but responsibility. By
                    accepting his appointment as the first ever “Regional Youth Ambassador for Palestine Refugees” by
                    the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) he will help spotlight UNHCR, the agency
                    providing assistance and protection to a population of more than 5 million registered Palestinian
                    refugees. Assaf said, “Being a young refugee myself, I can understand better than anybody else the
                    challenges and the opportunities before us. I’m committed to doing my very best to help UNRWA
                    succeed in giving other young people like me the same chance.”

                    witnessed in the camps, saying, “We have a responsibility to do all that we can so that every child
                    can be reached, their immediate needs are met, their health is safeguarded and they are protected
