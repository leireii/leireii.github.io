                    What is micro-credit and how is the growing global network of <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-html="true"

                        data-placement="top">micro-financing</a> changing the lives of
                    women in developing regions all around the world? Micro-credit is a system whereby participating
                    institutions provide applicants with small loans, which allow them to start or expand small
                    businesses -- selling handicrafts, prepared food, or flowers, to name just a few. Those accepted for
                    micro-credit loans are too poor to be approved for loans by conventional banks. But thanks to small
                    micro-credit loans--even with loans as small as $25., $50., or $100 -- women can significantly
                    develop their small enterprises and earn enough money to send children to school and build better
                    homes for their families. When enough families in a given region benefit from micro-credit loans,
                    the result is improvement in their communities' living standards and general quality of life.
                </p>

                    Women who apply for micro-credit must often do so as part of a cooperative of three to five women.
                    Each woman obtains a loan and each woman becomes the <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-html="true"
                        title="<b>guarantor:</b> <em>noun</em>; a person who agrees to be responsible for making sure a certain action will happen"
                        data-placement="top">guarantor</a> of the
                    loan of the other members of
                    the cooperative. In other words, each woman promises that all members of the cooperative will pay
                    back the loans to the bank. This approach has proved successful again and again and has shown
                    repeated success in many parts of the world. In acknowledgement of the system's contribution to
                    economic and social development, the United Nations declared 2005 "The International Year of
                    Micro-credit".
                    <br><br>
                    Micro-financing was originally begun by Muhammad Yunus, a Professor of Economics from Bangladesh. It
                    started when Yunus decided to try an experiment, making small loans to some Bangladeshi village
                    women so they could develop their businesses. Conventional banks would not even consider giving
                    loans to such poor women, but Mr. Yunus was determined to give the women a chance. His decision <a
                        class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>pay off:</b> <em>verb</em>; receive an advantage or reward from something one has done"
                        data-placement="top">paid off</a>. All the women in the "loan cooperative" paid him back -- and
                    on time. Loans were made to other
                    cooperatives with similar success. This led to the creation of the Grameen Bank, which believed that
                    poor women with an <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true" title="<b>entrepreneurial:</b> <em>adjective</em>; enterprising, as one who is ambitious and energetic enough to start 
                    a business" data-placement="top">entrepreneurial</a> spirit could be trusted to pay back
                    money they borrowed. As Mr.
                    Yunus says, the difference between the Grameen Bank, which he founded, and other banks is that
                    Grameen accepts credit as a human right and gives the highest priority to those most in need--those
                    with the least material wealth who are most in need of credit.
                    <br><br>
                    By 2005, the <b>International Year of Microcredit</b>, all corners of the world saw the
                    establishment of
                    successful micro-enterprise networks, many coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme.
                    When asked why 94% of micro-enterprise loans were given to women, Yunus replied,
