                    As you are reading this text, someone in your country has been affected by the AIDS crisis. People
                    in every part of the world have been affected by the AIDS pandemic. Every nation in the world has
                    had to take steps to address it. According to a recent United Nations estimate, 38.5 million people
                    across the globe are infected with HIV-AIDS.
                    <br><br>
                    Because AIDS has had such <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>far-reaching:</b> <em>adjective</em>; something that affects many areas"
                        data-placement="top">far-reaching</a> effects, in the year 2000, for the first time in the
                    history
                    of the United Nations, the Security Council took up a health issue - HIV-AIDS. The world body
                    declared the spread of the virus a global emergency, a threat to peace and security in Africa, the
                    continent that has been the hardest hit by the disease. The AIDS virus was considered no less
                    destructive than warfare itself. In the year 2000, armed conflict took the lives of 2,000 people in
                    Africa, while the AIDS virus claimed the lives of 2 million.
                    <br><br>
                    World-wide, the effect of the spreading AIDS virus has created 16.6 million orphans, 90 per cent of
                    whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where the crisis has been particularly deadly. Because so
                    many have died, the very infrastructure of the region is endangered. So many people who play key
                    roles in society - doctors, teachers, farmers - are dying of AIDS.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Part 2</h2>

                    What is the United Nations doing to address the AIDS crisis? UN-AIDS and its agencies have brought
                    some innovative ways of spreading the message that, first, people need to overcome the <a
                        class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>stigma:</b> <em>noun</em>; feelings of disapproval that a society has about particular illnesses or social behaviors"
                        data-placement="top">stigma</a> of
                    AIDS so they can come forward to learn about prevention, diagnosis and treatment. One way to
                    transmit this message is by providing education and AIDS awareness training to local community
                    members whose work brings them into regular contact with other members. One such local community
                    member is Paul Lopez, a hairdresser in Mexico City. Paulâ€™s clients tend to confide in him, their
                    regular hairdresser. Therefore, he was trained by a UN-AIDS programme to dispense advice about
                    testing and treatment of HIV-AIDS. Now, along with advice about beauty, Paul tells clients how they
                    can protect themselves from the AIDS virus or where they can go for treatment should they need it.
                    <br><br>
                    Another crisis that United Nations programmes address is the crisis of care produced by the
                    overwhelming number of AIDS orphans, 95 per cent of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, where the spread
                    of AIDS has been particularly lethal. Normally, when a child's parents die of AIDS, other family
                    members, such as uncles and aunts, will take responsibility for the orphaned child. But because
                    there are such increasing numbers of AIDS orphans and because the economic resources of some
                    communities are so limited, it is increasingly difficult to find adults who can take in extra
                    children. Often, children live by themselves in their <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-html="true" title="<b>deceased:</b> <em>adjective</em>; dead"

                    they can.

                <br>
                <h2>Part 3</h2>

                    A typical case is fourteen year-old Justin of Malawi, who has to care for his 10-year-old brother
                    and nine-year-old sister. Justin says it is very hard to find enough to eat although he does his
                    best to support himself and his <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>sibling:</b> <em>noun</em>; brother or sister" data-placement="top">siblings</a>
                    through his job carrying food for merchants. Since Justin
                    and his siblings have no one to take them in, they continue to live by themselves in their deceased
                    parents' home. United Nations and its agencies such as UNICEF sends aid workers and mobilizes
                    community-based volunteer groups to go to the homes or orphaned children with daily supplies of
                    food, money and advice on how to spend it. The aid workers also know the necessity of encouraging
                    the children to go to school. Children's chances of completing their education are cut in half once
                    they become orphans.
                    <br><br>
                    In the Ugandan village of Kalong, for example, a tragic scene that is all too common in rural
                    villages took place: six-year-old Nakeyeyune cried as the elders decided who would take custody of
                    her six-month-old brother and other young siblings after both his parents had died from AIDS-related
                    causes. In Uganda, one quarter of all families are caring for AIDS orphans. The poverty of many
                    rural families makes it difficult for them to take responsibility for more children.
                    <br><br>
                    One way the United Nations helps single and foster parents to raise income levels is by fostering
                    micro-credit cooperatives in rural villages. Micro-credit programmes allow traditional craft-makers
                    and farmers to form cooperatives and sell more of what they produce. The increased incomes enable
                    single and adoptive <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"

                        data-placement="top">foster parents</a> to raise their income levels so they can support
                    orphaned
                    children. Such programmes have been especially successful among single mothers.
