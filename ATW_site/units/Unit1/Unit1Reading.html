                    Although the dream of international cooperation has not always met with
                    success, it has never gone away. This dream has existed for centuries, but it was in the twentieth
                    century that the nations of the world tried to make it a reality. Individuals from around the world
                    worked in different ways to promote the vision of an international forum where nations could work
                    together to solve problems and conflicts that <a  class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"

                        data-placement="top">threaten</a> world stability
                    - a vision that came from, as
                    British writer and statesman, Leonard Woolf put it, "the international heart".
                    <br><br>
                    Woolf wrote a book called International Government in which he <a  class="vocab"
                        data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"

                        data-placement="top">advocated</a> the idea of a world body
                    that would help keep peace. Leonard Woolf and his wife, author Virginia Woolf began the Hogarth
                    Press—in part so they could publish and promote the idea of a League of Nations. Even earlier, in
                    the nineteenth century, writer H.G. Wells wrote "A Declaration of the Rights of Man", later used as
                    a basis for the United Nations Charter, along with "The Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man"
                    produced during the French Revolution. The name "United Nations" came from a poem by British poet,
                    Lord Byron, 'Here, where the sword united nations drew,/Our countrymen were warring on that day!'
                    Quoting Byron, Winston Churchill suggested the name, "United Nations", replacing President
                    Roosevelt's choice of "Associated Nations".
                    <br><br>
                    A French statesman, Leon Auguste Bourgeois, also called the "spiritual" father of the League of
                    Nations, worked <a  class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"

                    received the 1920 Nobel Peace Prize
                    for his efforts. Feminist <a  class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"

                    Although the belief in a cooperative body of nations had been very much alive on the intellectual
                    scene, it was the destruction caused by the First World War that moved the nations of the world to
                    act on this belief - to find, once again, the "international heart". Jan Smuts, Prime Minister of
                    South Africa worked closely with Woodrow Wilson, who was President of the United States from 1912 to
                    1921. Wilson responded to the world’s <a  class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"

                    president formally proposed
                    the idea of an international world forum, the U.S. never became a member of the League of Nations as
                    the U.S. Congress failed to <a  class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"

                    League of Nations treaty. For
                    his efforts to create a body to
                    bring about world peace, Wilson was awarded the Nobel peace Prize in 1919. While the League of
                    Nations ultimately disbanded, in part because it lacked US support and because it failed to prevent
                    the Second World War, Wilson's successor, President Roosevelt totally committed himself to working
                    toward the creation of a world body to preserve world peace. Roosevelt, who remained committed to
                    his leadership role even after being stricken by polio, died on April 12, 1945 -- less than two
                    weeks before the April 25 meeting in San Francisco, where delegates from 50 countries created the
                    United Nations Charter.
