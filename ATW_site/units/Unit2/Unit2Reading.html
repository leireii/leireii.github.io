                    University, which had offered it as a meeting site. Here they discussed possible plans for an
                    effective cooperative body of nations. At this meeting and at a broader meeting of world leaders in

                    The Secretariat was to act as the <b>administrative body</b>, serving the other organs of the United

                    The representatives of the original 51 member-states in San Francisco ratified the United Nations
                    Charter on 24 October 1945. Since, then the date, 24 October has been recognized as "United Nations
