                <h2>The Importance of Literacy</h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to read and write touches every aspect of our lives in contemporary society. Imagine for
                    a moment, how your life would be if you could not read or write even a simple sentence. How would
                    your life be different?
                    <br><br>
                    It is likely that you could not do the job you are doing now. Even if you operated a small
                    agricultural or crafts business in a rural town, you would not be able to keep records on your
                    inventory or be sure which customers owed you money. If you had to travel to a new area, it would be
                    difficult to navigate your way in a place with unfamiliar landmarks and you would not be able to
                    read street signs or words on maps. If you received a written message, you would need to depend on
                    another, <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>literate:</b> <em>adjective</em>; able to read and write"
                        data-placement="top">literate</a> person to tell you its contents. And you would have to be sure
                    that literate
                    person was accurate and honest. Also, you would have no independent access to written information on
                    health, news of the day, or opportunities in other places.
                    <br><br>
                    In areas with a low level of literacy, statistics show a clear connection between illiteracy and
                    poverty, poor health and the second class status of women.

                <h2>International World Literacy Day</h2>
                <p>
                    To bring attention to the importance of promoting literacy, back in 1966, UNESCO declared 8
                    September to be International World Literacy Day.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years, World Literacy Day, has <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>spawn:</b> <em>verb</em>; cause something to be developed"
                        data-placement="top">spawned</a> a number of literacy-promoting initiatives,. The
                    most recent is the “Global Alliance for Literacy” (GAL), begun in 2015. The GAL grew out of the
                    Millennium Development Goals (especially MDG number 4: “Achieve Universal Primary Education ”) and
                    also connects to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG number 4: “Quality Education”).
                    <br><br>
                    One way that GAL promotes literacy is by organizing contests to encourage the creation of innovative
                    <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>literacy:</b> <em>noun</em>; the ability to read and write"
                        data-placement="top">literacy</a> programmes across the globe. A prize was awarded to Nguyen
                    Quang Thach , who started the
                    “Center for Knowledge Assistance and Community Development”, which constructed 7,000 village
                    libraries in rural areas of his native Vietnam. Rural towns in many countries have either limited or
                    no access to books and other written materials as they rarely have libraries.
                    <br><br>
                    Another prize was awarded to a literacy training programme for villages of Kerala, India. The
                    programme, called “Vocational Skill Development for Sustainable Development”, focused on <a
                        class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>boost:</b> <em>verb</em>; make something increase, or become better or more successful"
                        data-placement="top">boosting</a>
                    literacy in areas where local people could apply it to <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-html="true" title="<b>lift:</b> <em>verb</em>; raise to a higher position or level"
                        data-placement="top">lift</a> themselves and their communities
                    socially and economically. One local person to benefit from such a programme in the Kerala village
                    of Pathappiriyam ,was Bushra, a woman who ran a small crafts business. After taking training in the
                    literacy programme, Bushra was able to keep records of materials and items bought and sold. As her
                    business expanded, she was also able to provide jobs for two other women who had benefitted from the
                    literacy programme.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Still a Long Road Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                    Such programmes have the power to change lives. And what has been the <a class="vocab"
                        data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>overall:</b> <em>adjective</em>; general, taking all into account"
                        data-placement="top">overall</a> impact of these
                    various efforts to promote literacy? In 1966, when World Literacy Day first began, just over half
                    the world population was literate, with a rate of 56 per cent. In 2016, the overall world literacy
                    rate has reached 83 per cent. Among young people, the literacy rate has become even higher: as of
                    2017, 91 per cent of young people between the ages of 15—24 are literate.
                    <br><br>
                    However, despite the positive trend, more work needs to be done. As of 2017, 749 million of the
                    world’s people remain <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip" data-html="true"
                        title="<b>illiterate:</b> <em>adjective</em>; not knowing how to read and write"
                        data-placement="top">illiterate</a>, meaning they cannot write or read a simple sentence. The
                    overwhelming majority (two thirds) of that number is women.
                    <br><br>
                    The statistics above refer to overall averages: one must <a class="vocab" data-toggle="tooltip"

                        data-placement="top">bear in mind</a> that literacy rates in given
                    countries range from the highest (100 per cent of the population) to the lowest (less than half the
                    population).
