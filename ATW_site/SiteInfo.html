                    Action through Words: Learning English through Learning about the United Nations is an online
                    self-study course created by United Nations staff member, <a target="_blank" href="founders.html"><b>Patricia
                            Duffy</b></a>, with the guidance
                    of <a target="_blank" href="founders.html#MEE"><b>Dr. Miriam Eisenstein Ebsworth</b></a>, Director of Ph.D. Programs
                    in Multilingual, Multicultural
                    Studies at New
                    York University. Technical assistance was offered by <b>Andrew Read</b> of Hunter College, City
                    University
                    of New York, original design was created by <b>Jill Kalotay</b>, and website updating was done by
                    <b>Leire Irizarry</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    While the primary audience for Action through Words is staff at UN duty stations where formal
                    language training in English is limited, the course is free and available to anyone with Internet
                    access.

                    As Action through Words is a work in progress, feedback from users is appreciated. Please contact

                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
                <p>
                    The generous help and confidence of a variety of people made the development of Action through
                    Words: learning English through Learning about the United Nations possible, and I would like to
                    thank some of those persons now.
                    <br><br>
                    First, I would like to thank all the members of the Selection Committee of the United Nations
                    Sabbatical Programme for awarding me the time to develop this project. I thank Ms Joan Bogle, United
                    Nations Training Officer, for her kind and professional guidance through the application process. I
                    thank Ms Jan Beagle, Director of Organizational Development, Ms Caroline Vaughan, Officer-in-Charge
                    of the UN Language and Communications Programme and Ms Elizabeth Kahn, Acting Coordinator of the UN
                    English Language Programme for their invaluable support of my proposal for this project. I also
                    thank Ms Laura Layton of UN OHRM, Dr. Michael Dixon of the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Dr.
                    Lawrence Marks of Yale University, and Ms Maxine Steinhaus of New York University for lending their
                    support to the proposal for Action through Words.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me extend a great thank you to Ms Jodi Nooyen, instructor in the UN Language and Communications
                    Programme. I thank Ms Nooyen, not only for her excellent feedback on my proposal, but also for her
                    courses in web site building and design. It was thanks to Ms Nooyen's committed teaching that the
                    seeds of inspiration for this web project were able to take root and continue to grow.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks also to my colleagues Mr. Bob Burbidge, Ms Linda Haley, Ms Mary Regan, Ms Francoise
                    Bouffault, and Mr. Ruben Delgado for their interest, encouragement, and feedback.
                    <br><br>
                    I would also like to thank Stephen C. Schlesinger, author of Act of Creation: The Founding of the
                    United Nations for his encouraging words at the start of this project.
                    <br><br>
                    A great thank you, too, to Mr. Andrew Read of Hunter College of the City University of New York for
                    so generously lending his expertise and time to this project. Mr. Read's knowledge -- and his
                    special ability to share it -- made carrying out this challenging task a great occasion for
                    learning. I would also like to thank Dr. Natasha Lvovich, Professor of English at Kingsborough
                    Community College of the City University of New York, and Ms Pauline Zalkin, student at Hunter
                    College, for their interest in this project and for their recommendation of Mr. Read.
                    <br><br>
                    Let me also thank UN staff members Mr. Fred Doulton, Mr. Michael Emery, Ms Hilary Rawe and Ms
                    Analisa Pereira of UN Peacekeeping, Ms Mary Ferriera, Ms Patricia Chan, and Ms Sherry Du of the UN

                    encouraging words and expert advice.
                    <br><br>
                    A big thank you to Martha Bordman, New York University and the City University of New York, for her
                    "pioneering spirit" in being among the first in her department to develop an online course and for
