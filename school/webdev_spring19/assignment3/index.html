        Michi is my cat. We've had him since 2012, when a colleague
        of my mother's sent out an e-mail saying that he found an
        abandoned, almost newborn kitten near his backyard and that
        he couldn't keep it due to his wife not being able to be near
        cats. He has a very unique personality and is honestly a jerk
        sometimes. However, he's my son and I love him with all my heart.
