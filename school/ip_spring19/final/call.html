        Scientists, doctors, and government officials of 2028,<br><br>
        I sincerely hope that you believe the contents of this archive and this letter. I am Dr. Ned Hartman, and I worked with the CDC
        from 2018 to now. By now, I mean May 17th, 2041. I have cooperated with entities that will remain unnamed to gain access to
        a secret US military project: a time travel machine. It is forbidden and very heavily punishable to send anything or anyone
        to the past or future.
        <br><br>
        The situation, however, is dire enough to justify this. I will go into hiding as soon as I send the flashdrives containing this site to the past——to your time.
        On June 23rd, 2028, surveyors opened a sealed passage in Jeita Grotto, Lebanon. There were unique opheocordyceps fungi there, and the spores spread extremely quickly,
        infecting insects and plants. The world became overrun by swarms. People can't go out without wearing special mycotoxin-filtering masks, the industry of which has been
        monopolized to boot.
        <br><br>
        The world has been at war over resources. Swarms and the fungus have killed and continue to kill our crops and our animals.
        <br><br>
        I am putting my life in peril to send this to you to tell you to <b>please</b> not allow this to happen in your future. Throughout this archive site, there is information
        about the fungus as well as history and evidence. It is up to you, now, to save the world this time.
        <br><br>
        Good luck,
        <br>
        Dr. Ned Hartman
      </p>
