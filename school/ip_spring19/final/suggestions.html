      <p>You could stop the excavation at the Jeita Grotto to prevent the spores from getting
        out into the world in the first place. This would not stop any future event from allowing
        them to be freed.

        Without the risk of imminent global doom, it would be difficult to convince the world to 
        fund heavy cure research and development. However, a smaller team could conduct advanced
        research using the research I also sent back.

        Risky, since it would require a lot of work in a little time. Appealing option to  those
        that don't want to change time a lot by changing events such as the excavation.
