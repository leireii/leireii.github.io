          <h2>THE FUNGUS</h2>
          <p>The plague fungus is called <em>Ophiocordyceps Toxicis</em>. Much like another member of the Ophiocordyceps family, Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis, this fungus
          spreads through 'infecting' other lifeforms. The fungus had been trapped in an isolated cave environment for years, and it took less than a year for international
          outrage to break out.<br><br>
          The species is called Toxicis because of the strong release of mycotoxins from its spores and fungal growths. The mycotoxins can cause respiratory issues and even
          poisoning symptoms in humans and some animals, and can prove life-threatening. They also harm the growth of plants.

        <h2>INFECTION</h2>
        <p>
          The fungus is only capable of truly 'infecting' insects and plants. In insects, the spores attach to their exoskeletons and spread. Growths begin to appear on their
          bodies and their brain chemistry is altered, leading in behavioral changes. In most insects (but most dangerously, locusts), intense and nonstop swarming and reproductive
          behavior is triggered.
